# fox flux advance

this is a port of [fox flux](https://github.com/eevee/fox-flux) to Rust and the Game Boy Advance

i started it for my week-long game jam, [GAMES MADE QUICK??? III](https://itch.io/jam/games-made-quick-iii), because i am completely out of my mind

the build system sucks and also needs some extra tools, sorry, but there's not a whole lot to play atm anyway so you're not missing much
